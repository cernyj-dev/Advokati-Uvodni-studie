## Project Overview

This repository contains the semestral work created for the course **BI-TIS (Information Systems Design)** at the Czech Technical University in Prague.

As part of this project, our team developed an **Introductory Study** and a **Presentation** for a simulated client: the law firm **ADVOKÁT s.r.o.**. Throughout the semester, we participated in simulated negotiation sessions during lab exercises. Our instructor, **Ing. Pavel Náplava, Ph.D.**, took on the role of the client representative.

Each meeting required proper preparation and follow-up documentation in the form of meeting minutes. Our objective was to elicit the client's requirements for a future information system — a task that was intentionally designed to mirror real-life challenges.

During the simulation, the instructor alternated between roles:
- As the **company owner**, he provided only high-level business goals and structural information.
- Later, as the **team manager**, he described more concrete technical requirements, which formed the basis for our system analysis and proposal.

## Tools and Approach

To support our work, we were provided access to a mock system named **INS@ček**, which included preconfigured software modules. Based on the client's requirements, I selected the most appropriate modules, proposed necessary adjustments, and identified features that would require custom development.

These decisions directly influenced the **cost estimation**, which we included in the final study along with:
- The project **vision**
- A proposed **implementation timeline**
- **Return on investment (ROI) analysis**
- And other key deliverables

## Deliverables

The final output includes:
- A **34-page Introductory Study** in PDF format
- A **Presentation** summarizing key points for stakeholder review
